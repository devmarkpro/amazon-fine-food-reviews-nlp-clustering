    "From the user and product statistics, we can see that the average number of reviews per user is around 2.22, with a maximum of 448 reviews by a single user. For products, the average number of reviews is about 7.66, with a maximum of 913 reviews for a single product. This indicates that while most users review only a few products, some users are very active in reviewing multiple products. Also, looking at the 75%, we can see that 75% of users have reviewed 2 or fewer products, and 75% of products have received 5 or fewer reviews. This suggests a long tail distribution where a few users and products are highly active while the majority are not. It's important to consider these statistics when training models, as they can impact the model's ability to generalize and the importance of certain users or products in the dataset. \n"
